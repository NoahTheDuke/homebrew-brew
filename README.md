# homebrew-brew

## How to use this tap

```shell
# If you have `clojure-lsp` from `homebrew-core`, remove it before using this formula
# That formula is deprecated and uses an outdated and non-native clojure-lsp version
brew remove clojure-lsp

# Then, use this tap
brew tap clojure-lsp/homebrew-brew
brew install clojure-lsp-native
```
